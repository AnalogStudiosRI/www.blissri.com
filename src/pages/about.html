        The Ocean State's indie music festival!
      </h1>

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        BlissRI began as a DIY music festival at Newport&apos;s Analog Studios in 2020.  As demand and buzz around the event increased, for the 2023 edition, BlissRI expanded to the much larger Restoration Hall on the campus of IYRS in the heart of downtown Newport.

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        We are excited to announce that we will be returning to Restoration Hall in 2024! 
      </p>

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        BlissRI is a showcase of the region&apos;s most creative, unique and engaging independent performers, visual artists and artisans, offering an immersive entertainment experience, held at the intersection of Newport&apos;s breathtaking harbor and urban energy.

      <h3 class="text-primary font-secondary font-bold text-4xl mb-8 mt-8">IYRS Restoration Hall:</h3>

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        Ordained with over a dozen two-story arched windows and crowned with a mezzanine section for overhead viewing, this space graciously provides amazing views of the harbor and a unique place to be inspired. It was originally built as the first home to the Newport Illumination Co. providing light to the city, and is now the heart of IYRS&apos; wooden boat building courses.  It was an honor to bring BlissRI to you from this space!
      </p>

      <p class="text-primary font-primary text-2xl mb-8 mt-8">
        For 2024, we are looking forward to another year of celebrating Rhode Island artists and performers and can&apos;t wait to see you there!
